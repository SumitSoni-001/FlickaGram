# FlickaGram
-> Flickagram is an Image viewer app that implements Flickr Api in order to get beautiful images from web.

-> We can see any image individually and can move to next/previous image simply by swiping the screen left/right.

-> You can share the link of Image and also the Image itself with your fiends and family members.
